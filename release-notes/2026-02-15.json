Your column selection is saved to your account and persists across sessions and devices.\n\nThis is especially useful as new signal types are added (like the optimized signal columns). You choose exactly what you want to see, and the table adapts. A \u201cReset to defaults\u201d option at the bottom restores the original column set.\n\nThe column chooser is built as a reusable component \u2014 expect it on other tables soon.",

Comfort mode increases font sizes, button targets (44px minimum), and spacing for easier interaction.\n\nIn comfort mode, the KRJ signals table uses fluid scaling: font sizes and padding automatically adjust based on the viewport width and number of visible columns. Fewer columns means each one gets more room. The table fills the screen intelligently without requiring manual adjustments.\n\nYour preference is saved to your account and applies across all pages.",
