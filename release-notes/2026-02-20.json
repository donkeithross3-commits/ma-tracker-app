      "summary": "Regime displacement weights now use Bayesian shrinkage for better out-of-sample performance.",
      "description": "The 30-cell regime weight matrix (macro_regime x leader_type) has been updated using Bayesian shrinkage toward the grand mean (k=50). Low-sample cells are pulled toward the population average proportional to 1/sqrt(n), preventing overfitting on sparse data.\n\nKey improvements: out-of-sample Sharpe improved from 0.74 to 0.82. Extreme weights from small samples were regularized (e.g., Stagflation|old_leader moved from -1.32 to 0.04). High-sample cells were barely affected. The original weights are preserved as a backup.",

      "summary": "Displacement signals are now suppressed during the first 5 days of a new regime to avoid false signals.",
      "description": "Research showed that the first 5 days after a regime transition have negative expected returns for displacement signals. A new age gate suppresses all signals to NEUTRAL during this period. The regime banner displays 'GATED' status when active. Signals resume after 5 days when the regime stabilizes and displacement gains predictive power (p=0.006 interaction effect).",

All SHORT signals are now overridden to NEUTRAL when the macro regime is Defensive Rotation. This eliminates the drag from the non-performing short book in this regime.",

The score combines regime probability decay (60% weight) and feature velocity (40% weight) based on research showing 93% precision at the 0.5 threshold.\n\nHovering the badge shows the full breakdown: warning score, probability instability, 3-week probability change, and feature velocity components. The warning helps anticipate regime changes before they trigger the age gate.",

      "description": "Displacement signals were invalid for ETFs (no GICS sector, benchmarked to SPY = just relative performance). ETF displacement is now suppressed and replaced with a regime-calibrated momentum/mean-reversion signal based on time-series autocorrelation research (script 30).\n\nThe signal map covers 16 ETFs across 5 groups: Equity Indices (DIA, SPY, QQQ, MDY, IWM, OEF), Commodities (GLD, SLV, USO), Sectors (XLE, XLF), Risk Assets (EEM, ARKK), and Safe Havens (TLT, HYG). Each (group, regime) pair uses the lookback and direction type (momentum or mean-reversion) with the strongest statistical significance from the research.\n\nOn the dashboard, ETF signals appear as blue-tinted pills (sky for LONG, indigo for SHORT) with regime bias tags ('mtm' or 'mr'). Non-significant signals are dimmed. Hovering shows the full breakdown: trailing return, z-score, lookback, and significance.",
