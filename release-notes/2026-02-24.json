      "description": "The portfolio dashboard (/sheet-portfolio) now fetches live stock prices from Polygon instead of relying on stale Google Sheet data.\n\n**Live price overlay:** The \"Crrnt Px\" column shows real-time prices in cyan when available, falling back to the sheet price if Polygon is unreachable.\n\n**Auto-refresh:** Prices poll every 60 seconds with a document.hidden guard so backgrounded tabs don't waste API calls.\n\n**Manual refresh:** A cyan refresh button next to \"Re-ingest Now\" triggers an instant price update with a spinning animation. A timestamp shows \"Live\" when data is fresh (< 2 min) or the last refresh time.\n\n**Recalculated yields:** Gross Yield and Current Yield columns recalculate on-the-fly using live prices, shown in cyan to distinguish from stale sheet values.\n\n**Live price change:** The \"Px Chng\" column shows Polygon's change percentage with green/red coloring.\n\n**Graceful degradation:** If Polygon is unavailable, all columns fall back to stale sheet values with no errors shown.",
