The sheet Re-ingest button remains available for manual Google Sheet refreshes.",

On failure, the toggle reverts and shows an inline error.\n\n**Admin gating:** The middleware blocks non-admin users from /admin/** and /api/admin/** routes, redirecting them to the dashboard. The \"Manage Users\" link in the UserMenu dropdown is only visible to the admin account.\n\n**User details:** The table shows each user's alias, email, role, project access toggles, and active status indicator.",
