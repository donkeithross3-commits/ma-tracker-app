      "description": "The IB Data Agent now tries the configured port first, then the other standard TWS port if the connection fails. You can start paper TWS (7497) or live TWS (7496) and run the agent without setting IB_PORT or IB_MODE in config.env.\n\nPort mapping follows official TWS defaults: 7497 = paper, 7496 = live. Config parsing also trims whitespace so values from config.env are read correctly.",

      "description": "Documentation and behavior now reflect that TWS Read-Only API mode only blocks order placement and order information — not market data (reqMktData) or positions. You can leave Read-Only **checked** when you only need quotes and want maximum safety against accidental API orders. Uncheck it when you need to place or manage orders; the socket port (7496 vs 7497) still determines which account (live vs paper) is used.",

      "description": "If the agent receives an error from IB indicating Read-Only API mode (e.g. \"order information is not available\" or \"read only\"), it sets an internal flag and from then on:\n\n- Does not call reqPositions or reqOpenOrders (returns empty lists)\n- Does not call reqOpenOrders on reconnect\n- Place, modify, and cancel order requests return a clear message: \"TWS is in Read-Only API mode. Uncheck Read-Only in TWS API Settings to place orders.\"\n\nMarket data (quotes) and contract lookups continue to work. The status response includes **read_only_session** and the dashboard can show \"IB TWS connected (Read-Only — quotes only, no positions/orders)\" so users know why positions/orders are empty.",
