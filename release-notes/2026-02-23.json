      "description": "On the Account tab, when you open the order entry ticket for an option position, the ticket now shows:\n\n**Underlying quote** — Unchanged: the latest quote for the underlying (with refresh and \"Use as price\" for stock tickets).\n\n**Option quote** — For option tickets only: the latest bid, ask, and mid for the specific option you're trading. A dedicated refresh button lets you refresh this option quote on demand while you set quantity and limit price.\n\n**Use mid as price** — When an option quote is loaded, a button sets the limit price to the option mid so you can quickly align with the current market.",

      "description": "For users with Comfort Mode on, the Account tab positions table no longer truncates column headers or data with ellipses.\n\n**Smart defaults:** Positions default to 4 columns (Symbol, Pos, P&L, Trade) so each column gets more space. A hint under the column chooser explains: \"Fewer columns by default so each stays readable. Use the chooser above to add more.\"\n\n**Scroll instead of clip:** The table has a minimum width in Comfort mode; if the card is narrower, the table scrolls horizontally so you can see all content. Cell text uses overflow-visible in Comfort so nothing is cut off.\n\n**Trade column always visible:** The Trade column (Trade + Risk Manager buttons) has a fixed minimum width (7.5rem) so the buttons are never cut off, in any mode.",

The first click runs immediately; repeated clicks within 500ms are ignored.\n\nImplemented via a reusable hook, useDebouncedCriticalClick, so future confirm dialogs can use the same pattern. Aligns with PD UI research recommending 300–500ms debounce on order-entry buttons.",

Helps users who use a tablet or touchscreen.\n\n**Motion:** When the OS has not set \"Reduce motion,\" Comfort mode still shortens transitions on buttons, tabs, checkboxes, and menu items to 0.08s. Reduces motion sensitivity without requiring the system preference.",
